    # If the MCP server needs to expose a port or volume, configure it here.
    # Based on docs, it typically operates via stdio or SSE if configured.
    # For a standalone container, we might need to check if it exposes an HTTP endpoint for MCP.
    # Assuming standard MCP behavior, it might need an SSE adapter if accessed remotely.
    # For now, we'll keep it simple.
